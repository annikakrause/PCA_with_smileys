# PCA with smileys and faces

This project intuitively explains PCA using visual and interactive examples, implemented as Jupyter notebooks. \
With the first notebook, one can learn how PCA is performed - conceptually, mathematically and in Python code - and experience it with the interactive example of a smiley face in 2D.

The second notebook builds on that and transfers the knowlegde to a more complex example: a face in 3D. \
Together, the two Jupyter Notebooks offer an opportunity to deeply understand the basics of PCA in different settings. 

Both Jupyter notebooks are provided publically via Google colab:
